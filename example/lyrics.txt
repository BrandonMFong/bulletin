tomorrow
...
i lose my mind
when you dont talk to me
my head
feels so deep
im incomplete
im not walking in a line
i cant be right
i dont know why
my devil needs to play
cant breathe
it drives me insane
were on the same team
im scared it got too far
i feel so dark
the sun beams through my eyes
alone again outside
i stayed up through the night
lonely... thinking...
dont need to be right
